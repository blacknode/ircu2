/** @file
 * @brief The connection pools: a queue, some threads, and the copying.
 *
 * There is one pool per role.  A pool is a queue and a fixed number of
 * connection threads that take from it, and it is the only thing the two
 * sides of this driver share -- so it is also the only thing with a lock.
 *
 * @section pg_copy Nothing is shared but the queue
 *
 * A query arrives in the main thread as a #DbQuery pointing at the caller's
 * memory, which may be a local variable and is certainly not going to
 * outlive the call.  pg_pools_submit() copies all of it -- the statement,
 * every parameter, every byte of every value -- into a #PgRequest allocated
 * with worker_alloc(), and that copy is what crosses the boundary.  The
 * answer comes back the same way: a JSON value built in the connection
 * thread, handed over through worker_post(), released in the main thread.
 *
 * @section pg_lazy Pools start when they are first needed
 *
 * A module is loaded from its @c Module{} block, which may appear before the
 * @c Database{} block in ircd.conf, so mi_init is too early to read the
 * configuration and much too early to start a thread.  Instead the pool for
 * a role is built the first time a query asks for it, and torn down when
 * db_conf_generation() says the configuration underneath it has changed.  A
 * server that never runs a query never opens a connection.
